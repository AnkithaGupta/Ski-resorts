# Ski-resorts
A data driven approach to understand price determinants of ski resorts 

# Introduction
The objective of this project is to address the business problems of optimizing pricing strategies and improving operational efficiency for ski resorts. The ultimate goal is to increase revenue and customer satisfaction, while simultaneously improving employee retention and ensuring that the resort is providing high-quality services to its visitors. In addition to this analysis, we will also conduct a predictive analysis . 

By analyzing factors such as resort location, season, lift capacity, and customer survey responses, the proposed program aims to help ski resorts determine the optimal price for lift tickets and other services, while also identifying areas where additional resources or process improvements could increase operational efficiency and reduce costs. 

We hope that our research will help ski resort business owners to understand the factors that influence the pricing of their services and the efficiency of their operations.
